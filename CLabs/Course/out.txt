Overtime you lost the line
The growing box of self declineThe growing box of self decline
There's silent anger so loud
Behind the keys to it all on my inside
Say what you will, what you will
Anything for a kill, for a kill
Run 'em down til you wear the crown
Say what you will, what you will
Anything for the thrill of a kill
Beat them down til' they're underground
